    <h1>Hi Reader🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️</h1>
    <p>Starting back from 2018, I was in 8th class, that was the computer period and I was getting bored in that lecture, our Computer Teacher take us to the computer lab in our school, we all went to the computer lab and just take our places in front of each computer. Before 2018 Computer subject was a hell for me and I do not like that subject at all, but on that day my complete idea behind the computer was changed. Back to the story I was sitting with one of my close friend, he asked me that can I use the computer, I said "Yea of course, I am already getting bore" so he just turned on the computer and then just simply open one software (that was Turbo C++) and then just started typing some random words with symbols, I didn't get that what he was typing so I just asked him that what are you typing, he said "I am coding", for a while I just get silent, I was like "WHATTT!!!, you are coding " he said yes, after this I started gaining interest in coding and all, and somewhere I like to use computer coz I loved the practical work rather than theory, from this point my coding journey started, then I started discovering these all stuff and all that, I started this in 2018 when I was in 8th and now it is 2023 now I have just given my boards. </p>
